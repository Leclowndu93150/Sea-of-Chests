# Texture Needed

A texture file is needed at:
`src/main/resources/assets/sea_of_chests/textures/item/magnifying_glass.png`

The texture should be a 16x16 pixel image showing a magnifying glass icon, typically featuring:
- A circular lens (glass pane)
- A handle (stick/iron material)
- Appropriate shading and highlights

This should match Minecraft's art style and fit with the existing item textures in the mod.
